# Step 4: make a web app with a single web page
# Topics info
# - imports: `import package_name` to be able to use other code (written by you, or by somebody else)
#   - to use someone else's code, you have to download it to your computer before you can use it (we will use pip for downloading)
#   - (discuss in person)
# - server / client: code runs in different places. the client is usually the user's computer, the server is somewhere else.
#   - (discuss in person)
# - flask: a python package that helps you make a server (http://flask.pocoo.org/)
#   - you import flask (cuz it's code someone else wrote), then use its functions to make a server.

## EXAMPLE: import the built-in package called math and use one of its functions it gives you

import math
import your_file

sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
how_many_of_us = your_file.soon_to_be(2)

## PROBLEM

## TODO: follow the example http://flask.pocoo.org/
# - create a new file, hello.py
# - install flask and run your server
# - visit your web page in Chrome
# - make your web page say "Let me guess. You have a great personality." instead of "Hello World!"
